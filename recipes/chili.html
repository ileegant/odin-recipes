<h4>Description:</h4>
		
<p>Homemade chili is delicious and goes great with cornbread or over corn chips for a chili pie! I like to use spicy pinto beans.</p>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
		
<ul>
	<li>1 pound ground beef</li>
	<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
	<li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
	<li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans</li>
	<li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
	<li>1 1/2 cups water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
	<li>1 pinch chili powder, or more to taste</li>
	<li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
	<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
		
<ol>
	<li>Place ground beef and onion in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
	<li>Stir in tomato sauce, kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes with juice. If you prefer a thinner consistency, you can add water. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 15 minutes.</li>	
</ol>
